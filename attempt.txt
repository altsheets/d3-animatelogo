Hi  javascriptissexy at (you know) gmail.com

Thx for your EXCELLENT article on "this" and "that" :-)
http://javascriptissexy.com/understand-javascripts-this-with-clarity-and-master-it/

I have spent many hours, but I cannot find the flaw in my construction. 
You are my last hope *g*


Please compare these two outputs, visually:

http://altsheets.ddns.net/d3/animatelogo/animatelogo_attempt.html


In the latter, I had been trying to get rid of this stupid redundancy of 12 identical getter&setter functions (*):
https://github.com/altsheets/d3-animatelogo/blob/master/animatelogo.js#L137-L196

by creating them automatically:
https://github.com/altsheets/d3-animatelogo/blob/master/animatelogo_attempt.js#L148-L155


BUT

something does not work. 

And I think it might be my lack of understanding of the this-function.

Perhaps you can immediately see my flaw? 
(I have already tried many things, with and without 'that', etc.)


It is a strategy that I have been successfully using a lot - but in Python. 
Now I am new to JS, and some picky details are hair tearingly different. 


Thanks a million. And keep up the good work! Enjoy your late summer!

your AltSheetsDev
