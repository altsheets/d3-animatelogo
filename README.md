# d3-animatelogo (v01)
Logo animation  
with chained transitions,
and clickable logo group.

My first real D3 project (after my [quick'n'dirty hack](http://altsheets.ddns.net/assetgraphs/graph01.html) during the [nxthacks 2015](http://altsheets.ddns.net/nxthacks2015)).

## @DEMO - See this live

http://altsheets.ddns.net/d3/animatelogo/

## @questions    
As this is my first one, and my favorite language is Python, not JS ... I might have chosen strange ways - happy to receive your criticism.  I have already formulated some issues, please see the source code of [animatelogo.html](animatelogo.html) and [animatelogo.js](animatelogo.js).

## @quickstart
Clone it, and open in in your (JavaScript-enabled) browser

    git clone https://github.com/altsheets/d3-animatelogo.git
    cd d3-animatelogo
    
    firefox animatelogo.html

## @dependencies
    d3.js
    d3-transform.js

for the amazing ["Data Driven Documents"](http://d3js.org/) JS library, and the useful [d3-transform](https://github.com/trinary/d3-transform) extension.
