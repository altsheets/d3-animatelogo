# d3-animatelogo (v01)
Logo animation  
with chained transitions,
and clickable logo group.

My first real D3 project (after my quick'n'dirty hack during the [nxthacks 2015](http://altsheets.ddns.net/nxthacks2015).

## @quickstart

    git clone https://github.com/altsheets/d3-animatelogo.git
    cd d3-animatelogo
    
    firefox animatelogo.html

## @DEMO - See this live

http://altsheets.ddns.net/d3/animatelogo/


## @questions    
As this is my first one, I might have chosen strange ways.  
Also, I have already formulated some issues, please see the sourcecode of [animatelogo.html] and [animatelogo.js].


## @dependencies
Would be nice if *d3-transform* got a URL home, see issue https://github.com/trinary/d3-transform/issues/13 .   
Until then:

    cd d3-animatelogo
    git clone https://github.com/trinary/d3-transform
